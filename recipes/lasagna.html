    <h2>How to make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, lasagna. How I love thee! It is possibly one of the most loved foods in the whole wide world, and understandably so. There is just something so sentimental about lasagna, so comforting. It evokes images of of gatherings with family and friends all around the world. It is the sort of food that is like a big warm hug, and so more-ish you want to keep digging in until you burst.</p><p>Lasagna just rocks. Full stop.</p>

    <h3>3 Parts to making the Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The meat sauce;</li>
        <li>The white sauce – creamy and thick, but no cream required!</li>
        <li>Assembling and baking.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><strong>Meat Sauceis</strong> basically just like Bolognese. You need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion, garlic, carrot and celery – for the flavour base, a soffrito;</li>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Canned tomato and tomato paste</li>
        <li>Red wine – for extra flavour!</li>
        <li>Seasonings – beef bouillon cubes (stock cubes), bay leaves, thyme, oregano, Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the white sauce</strong>, you need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For assembling</strong>, you need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>lasagna sheets – preferably fresh (from the fridge section of grocery stores) but dried works just fine too</li>
        <li>cheese!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make lasagne</h3>
    <p>See? I told you the meat sauce is just like making Bolognese! Though here, we cook that meat sauce long and slow, to develop incredible rich flavours and make the beef melt-in-your-mouth tender.</p>
    <h3>Layering up!</h3>
    <p>And here’s how you layer it up:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Smear</strong> a bit of meat sauce on the base first – stops the lasagna sheets from sliding around;</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 1 –</strong> top with meat sauce, bit of white sauce</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 2 –</strong> lay out more lasagna sheets, then top with more meat sauce and more white sauce</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 3 –</strong> repeat again, lasagna sheets, meat sauce then white sauce; and</li>
        <li><strong>Topping –</strong> cover with lasagna sheets, pour over remaining white sauce then sprinkle with cheese.</li>
    </ul>
