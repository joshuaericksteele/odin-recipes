    <h2>How to make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, lasagna. How I love thee! It is possibly one of the most loved foods in the whole wide world, and understandably so. There is just something so sentimental about lasagna, so comforting. It evokes images of of gatherings with family and friends all around the world. It is the sort of food that is like a big warm hug, and so more-ish you want to keep digging in until you burst.</p><p>Lasagna just rocks. Full stop.</p>

    <h3>3 Parts to making the Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The meat sauce;</li>
        <li>The white sauce – creamy and thick, but no cream required!</li>
        <li>Assembling and baking.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What goes in lasagna</h3>
    <p><strong>Meat Sauceis</strong> basically just like Bolognese. You need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion, garlic, carrot and celery – for the flavour base, a soffrito;</li>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Canned tomato and tomato paste</li>
        <li>Red wine – for extra flavour!</li>
        <li>Seasonings – beef bouillon cubes (stock cubes), bay leaves, thyme, oregano, Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the white sauce</strong>, you need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For assembling</strong>, you need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>lasagna sheets – preferably fresh (from the fridge section of grocery stores) but dried works just fine too</li>
        <li>cheese!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make lasagne</h3>
    <p>See? I told you the meat sauce is just like making Bolognese! Though here, we cook that meat sauce long and slow, to develop incredible rich flavours and make the beef melt-in-your-mouth tender.</p>
    <h3>Layering up!</h3>
    <p>And here’s how you layer it up:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Smear</strong> a bit of meat sauce on the base first – stops the lasagna sheets from sliding around;</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 1 –</strong> top with meat sauce, bit of white sauce</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 2 –</strong> lay out more lasagna sheets, then top with more meat sauce and more white sauce</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 3 –</strong> repeat again, lasagna sheets, meat sauce then white sauce; and</li>
        <li><strong>Topping –</strong> cover with lasagna sheets, pour over remaining white sauce then sprinkle with cheese.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>1/2 cup (75g) flour</li>
    <li>4 cups (1 litre) milk (I use low fat)</li>

    <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Finely chopped basil or parsley , for garnish (optional</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Ragu:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet - they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
    <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
    <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
    <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich - see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required (Note 3)</li>
</ol>
